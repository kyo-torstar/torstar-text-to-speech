TTC fares, budget to increase in bid to increase transit system security.The TTC will hire 50 new special constables in the wake of a spike in violence on the transit system.The TTC is set to hike fares by 10 cents and get a $53-million subsidy increase from the city to hire 50 more special constables as the transit service grapples with a spike in violent crime, Mayor John Tory announced Wednesday.The funding increase would also hire 10 more Streets-to-Home outreach workers, freeze the cost of monthly passes for seniors, and add 50,000 more users to the low-income discount program, Tory said.Speaking ahead of the full 2023 city budget launch slated for Tuesday, he said the extra staff will — if city council approves — augment the 80 special constables and 10 outreach workers now dedicated to the TTC.Tory’s push for increased patrols on subways, buses, streetcars and in stations comes one day after he proposed a $48.3-million boost in Toronto’s police budget to hire more officers — a move criticized by some who say more social supports for people in crisis, not more badges, are needed to make Toronto safer.As with other transit systems during the pandemic, the TTC has been plagued by ongoing low ridership. Use has not rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, resulting in a sustained drop in the revenues that help fund the system. Last summer, ridership was at 65 per cent of pre-pandemic levels.At the same time, riders sticking with the system have seen an increase in violent crime, triggering concerns that a recent spate of brutal and random attacks will keep people away from subways, buses and streetcars.“The TTC has to be a safe place for everyone — every rider and for every TTC employee, and that safety has to be 24-7,” Tory said, adding he wants riders to both be more safe and to feel safe using the system.He said Wednesday’s announcement comes along with a targeting of “hot spots” in the transit system identified through police and transit incident tracking, an increased police presence and more training for TTC employees.When asked about critics who are concerned about the impact of an increased authority presence on marginalized and racialized communities, Tory was skeptical that having 130 special constables could be considered “over-policing on a system as huge as this.”He said there has already been an increase in de-escalation training in the wake of past violence involving special constables. A review of enforcement data between 2008 and 2018 found that Black and Indigenous residents are more likely to be charged or cautioned than white ones and are “grossly overrepresented” in interactions with TTC officers.“The job here is not to make people’s lives more difficult than they already are. The job here is to try to de-escalate things that are going on, try to prevent things from starting in the first place and try to make sure the customers and employees of the TTC feel safe and are safe,” he said.The TTC is a microcosm of Toronto, which is struggling with a mental health crisis, a housing crisis and a drug poisoning crisis, all of which have persisted for decades but which reached a tipping point during the pandemic.Dave Shellnutt, a personal injury lawyer who represents victims of police violence, said after Tory’s announcement “it’s unfortunate that when more special constables are proposed to be hired money is forthcoming, but looking for more equitable fare options, or free transit is so difficult to consider.”Shellnutt called it “no shock” that Tory’s two announced budget boosts relate to “policing the public.”“Recent examples of violence on the TTC will not be solved by adding 50 more special constables,” he said. “However, what will assuredly increase will be the number of “enforcement incidents” involving Black and Indigenous people, already grossly overrepresented in these incidents.”The city subsidy proposed for the TTC in 2023 totals $958.7 million, an increase of 5.85 per cent from 2022.`
